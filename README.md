## Work Tracker

# Description
This project will be using GO programming language to create a Web Application that tracks the amount of work done by specific Tradesmen. For Example, if I was a farmer and I wanted to tell my boss the amount of work I had done and details about that work I would use this application to log in with my personal details, pick my job from a dropdown list and a few other specific details and then I will enter the details into a textbox and submit it to my boss. All work done would be tracked on my specific account and the same goes for other accounts.

The main aim is for the Tradesman to have to do the minimal amount of work to use this app as it shouldn't be a hassle to use (many tradesmen are not tech-savvy so we need to avoid confusion). The use of dropdown lists/radio buttons/forms should achieve this as opposed to data entry into textboxes by the person.

Go to the wiki section for more info on how to use this app.
